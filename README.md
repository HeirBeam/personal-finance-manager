### Running the Apps

#### 1. Personal Finance Manager App

This is the main finance management app where you can upload a `.txt` file with transaction data for analysis.

#### 2. Transaction Data Entry UI

This UI lets you create transaction files if you donâ€™t have one ready to upload.

```bash
streamlit run generate_transactions_ui.py
```

- **Enter transaction details** in the provided fields (date, type, amount, category).
- **Amount Validation**: The app ensures that only amounts greater than zero can be added.
- **Download the generated file** as `transactions.txt` and use it in the main app.
